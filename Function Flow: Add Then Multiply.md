## Math Function Flow

You won't be doing much, if any, math while in class, but basic math functions are simply to write, so you will be doing that in this exercise.

* The plus sign (+) is used to add numbers in JavaScript
* The asterisk (*) is used to multiply numbers in JavaScript

You are provides two blank functions. 

1. The add() function takes two parameters - the two numbers that you want to add together.
2. The multiplyByTwo() function take one parameter - the number you want to multiply by 2.
3. In the add() function, add the values of the two parameters and return the result
4. In the multiplyByTwo() function, multiply the value of the single parameter by 2 and return the result.

## Running the Tasks

After the functions are defined, invoke them in the correct order.

1. Invoke the add() function, provide two values as arguments, and the store what gets returned into a variable.
2. Then invoke the multiplyByTwo() function and provide the variable from the previous step as the argument. Store the result into a variable.
3. Use `console.log()` to output the value of the variable you declared in the previous step.


# Sample Code

```js
const add = (firstNumber, secondNumber) => {

}

const multiplyByTwo = (numberToMultiply) => {

}
```
